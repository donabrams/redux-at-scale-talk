                    ## Previous Architectures

                    1. jQuery
                    2. jQuery + EventEmitter
                    3. Angular
                    4. Raw React + EventEmitter
                    <aside class="notes">
                        We all have our biases
                        Before redux we just used raw react; usually populated via EventEmitter. React was obviously nice for views

                    ## Components

                    - Awesome for reuse
                    - Isomorphic needs
                    - Easiest to understand/debug when they don't have state
                    - Trigger events we understand the effects of (+ backtrace)
                    <aside class="notes">
                        Isomorphic is important for not writing things twice and SEO.
                        Debuggability and ability to arbitrarily delete code and understand what we'd break also important.

                    ## Flux

                    - Boilerplate sucks
                    - Large/complex codebases
                    - They want to control everything!
                    <aside class="notes">
                        Lots of boilerplate for little gain. We had a policy of only bringing in code bases we could read/fix bugs in reliably.
                        Mutation still rampant.

                    ## Redux

                    - lightly namespaces states
                    - "reducer" style of state mutation
                    - `connect` injects state and a `dispatcher` into components
                    - serializable actions
                    - one way binding

                    <aside class="notes">
                        Mention that the word action is overloaded and in redux it's a state machine transition.
                        Talk about reducers and where that comes from
                        mention reducer is a poor man's composable state machine

                    ## Best Practices for Scale

                    - dumb views
                    - encapsulated CSS
                    - "smart" components
                    - pragmatic immutability
                    - monorepo
                    - normalized reducers
                    - asynchronous actions

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## Dumb views

                        - easiest to debug
                        - easiest to reuse
                        - proptypes are usage docs
                        - easily can go into style libraries
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## Dumb view Example

                        <pre><code data-trim data-noescape class="jsx">
export default function CatCard({name, picUrl, 
        cutenessRating, isSpecial, toggleFavACat}) {
    const percentCuteStyle = {
        width: `${cutenessRating/5*100}%`,
    }
    return (
        &lt;section>
            &lt;aside display-if={isSpecial} class="catCard__specialStar"/>
            &lt;h2 class="catCard__name">{name}&lt;/div>
            &lt;img class="catCard__pic" src={picUrl} onClick={()=>toggleFavACat()}/>
            &lt;div class="catCard__cuteness">
                &lt;div class="catCard__percent" style={percentCuteStyle}/>
            &lt;/div>
        &lt;/section>
    )
}
CatCard.propTypes = { /*...*/ }
                        </code></pre>

                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    ## CSS

                    - keep CSS next to the component
                    - Use BEM or some method of encapsulation
                    <aside class="notes">
                        Destructuring clarity, jsx and setState() problems makes it worth it to 
                        Some plugins to do immutable.js destructuring, would be so worth it, but react/redux have trouble too (shallow equality and namespacing).

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## Smart components

                        - thin wrapper around dumb views
                        - take in the smallest # of data properties
                        - merge state from multiple reducers
                        - handles computed properties
                        - may inject some transient state
                        - advice: use [recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose)
                        <aside class="notes">
                            Mention that recompose might not be best if you're reusing this logic for iOS/Android, but it's easily refactorable.

                        ## Smart component example

                        <pre><code data-noescape class="jsx">
import {connect} from 'react-redux'
import CatCard from '@org/cat-card'
import {toggleFavACat} from '@org/cat-actions'

            ...catCards.get(catId).toJS(),
            isSpecial: favCats.has(catId),
        }),
        (dispatch, {catId}) => ({
            toggleFavACat: toggleFavACat(dispatch, catId),
        })

                </section>
                <section data-markdown>
                    ## Immutable state

                    - Keep state in actions/reducers immutable
                    - Use plain objects in react
                    <aside class="notes">
                        Destructuring clarity, jsx and setState() problems makes it worth it to 
                        Some plugins to do immutable.js destructuring, would be so worth it, but react/redux have trouble too (shallow equality and namespacing).

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## Normalized Reducers

                        - Reuse actions across multiple reducers
                        - Keep reducer data "flat"
                        - Makes clearing old data harder, but good enough for now
                        - Use reducers all the time instead of state

                        <aside class="notes">
                            Page transition is a good time for clearing. Having your router "rehydrate" just what ya wanna keep is also valid.
                            Very transient state, like isOpen is occasionally alright-- until ya wanna close it.

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## Normalized reducer example

                        <pre><code data-noescape class="jsx">
import {TOGGLE_FAV_A_CAT} from '@org/cat-actions'
import {Map} from 'immutable'

const initialState = Map()

export default function favCatsReducer(action, state=initialState) {
    switch(action.type) {
        case TOGGLE_FAV_A_CAT: {
            const {catId} = action
            return state.set(catId, !state.has(catId))
        }
        default:
            return state
    }
}
                        </code></pre>
                        <aside class="notes">
                            Notice that this isn't mutating the catCard.
                            Also notice that the constant is defined on the action. Reducers respond to actions, not the other way around.

                    ## Monorepo

                    - All your components in one place
                    - Make it easy to move components around w/o breaking things
                    - Multiple apps in one repo
                    - Shared boilerplate code (build, testing, fixtures, style lib, linting, etc)
                    - No great examples yet (but talked about by [fb](https://hashnode.com/post/10-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-javascript-react-and-nodejs-and-graphql-development-at-facebook-cink0r0e500h5io53fpl7ediu))

                    ## Async actions

                    - This is where the devil lies
                    - Simple, use [thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk)
                    - Simple Promises, use [redux-promise](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-promise)
                    - Complex, use [sagas](https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga)
                    - Animations should def use sagas.
